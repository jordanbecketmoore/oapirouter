	Long: `oapirouter is a command-line tool that helps you generate
HTTPRoute resources for Kubernetes from OpenAPI specifications.
It simplifies the process of creating and managing HTTPRoute resources
to handle the routing of HTTP requests in your applications inside a Kubernetes cluster
using Gateway API resources.

Example usage:
oapirouter --name my-route --namespace my-namespace --gateway-name my-gateway --input /path/to/openapi.yaml
This command will generate an HTTPRoute resource based on the provided OpenAPI spec and print it to stdout.`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	err := rootCmd.Execute()
